We also handled logical expressions involving more than one relational expressions involving floats .
for this we loaded the  result of float comparisons into a register by using branching on bc1t, bc1f
and from there it is similar to int case.
so the spim code will differ for single relational expression involving floats since we 
added support for generic case.
